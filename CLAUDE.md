## About Python code

Always follow these guidelines when writing or editing Python code in
this project:

- Always use `uv` as the package manager whenever a package needs to be
  installed (including in Colab).
- Write all docstrings in English.
- Docstrings must be complete: describe the input parameters
  (`Parameters`) and the return value (`Returns`).
- When a function or method is complex, include a usage example in the
  docstring (`Example` section).
- Respect the per-line character limit in docstrings according to
  PEP 8 / PEP 257 (79 characters).
- Variables, functions, classes and methods must have descriptive,
  meaningful names written in English.
- Use type hints on function and method parameters and return values.
- Do not use type hints on simple variable assignments inside the body
  of the code.
- Do not add comments in the code — keep only the docstrings.
- Whenever a function or method has 2 or more parameters, break the
  signature across multiple lines, one parameter per line, for example:

```python
def func1(
    param_1: type_1,
    param_2: type_2,
    ...
    param_n: type_n,
) -> type_of_return:
```

- Whenever production code is created or changed, add (or update) the
  corresponding unit tests under `tests/`, mirroring the structure of
  the source package.
- Always check whether the existing documentation (README, docstrings,
  files under `docs/`, if any) is still consistent with the change; if
  it needs an update, update it right away.

## About notebooks

- Before each code cell, add a text (Markdown) cell briefly explaining
  what the following code cell does or should do.
- Every notebook must start with a header (Markdown cell) containing:
  - Name: Renan Santos Mendes
  - Email: renansantosmendes@gmail.com
  - Course subject: `<COURSE_SUBJECT_PLACEHOLDER>`
  - Program: `<PROGRAM_PLACEHOLDER>`
- Do not use emojis or emoticons anywhere in the notebook (code or text
  cells), to keep the course material looking professional.
